# ttt

`ttt` is TUI (text-based user interface) based file manager. I've tried both [fff](https://github.com/dylanaraps/fff) and [nnn](https://github.com/jarun/nnn) and decided I can do if not better than at least simplier.

`ttt` is pure .NET Core application, so it should be easy to run anywhere on major platforms.
